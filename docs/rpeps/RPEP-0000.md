# Abstract

RPEP stands for ReactPy Enhancement Proposal. An RPEP is a design
document providing information to the ReactPy community, or describing
a new feature for ReactPy or its processes or environment. The RPEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend RPEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting
the design decisions that have gone into ReactPy. The RPEP author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions.

Because the RPEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal. This historical record is available by the normal git
commands for retrieving older revisions, and can also be browsed
`on GitHub <https://github.com/reactive-python/rpeps>`\_\_.

# RPEP Audience

The typical primary audience for RPEPs are the core developers of the
ReactPy however, other parts of the ReactPy community may also choose to
use the process (particularly for Informational RPEPs) to document expected
API conventions and to manage complex design coordination problems that
require collaboration across multiple projects.

# RPEP Types

There are three kinds of RPEP:

1. A **Specification** RPEP describes a new feature or standard for
   ReactPy. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will
   be supported outside of ReactPy versions before a subsequent RPEP
   adds support in a future version of ReactPy.

2. An **Informational** RPEP describes a ReactPy design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the ReactPy community,
   but does not propose a new feature. Informational RPEPs do not
   necessarily represent a ReactPy community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
   Informational RPEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** RPEP describes a process surrounding ReactPy, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process RPEPs are
   like Standards Track RPEPs but apply to areas other than the ReactPy
   language itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to
   ReactPy's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational RPEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in ReactPy development.
   Any meta-RPEP is also considered a Process RPEP.

## Start with an idea for ReactPy

The RPEP process begins with a new idea for ReactPy. It is highly
recommended that a single RPEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea; the more focused the RPEP, the more successful it tends to be.
Most enhancements and bug fixes don't need an RPEP and
can be submitted directly to the
[ReactPy issue tracker](https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy/issues).
The RPEP editors reserve the
right to reject RPEP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too
broad. If in doubt, split your RPEP into several well-focused ones.

Each RPEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the RPEP using the style
and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The RPEP
champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is
RPEP-able. Posting to the
[ReactPy Discussion Forum](https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy/discussions)
is usually the best way to go about this, unless a more specialized venue is
appropriate.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing an RPEP is meant
to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing ReactPy that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the ReactPy community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where ReactPy is used.

Once the champion has asked the ReactPy community as to whether an
idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft RPEP should be presented to
the appropriate venue mentioned above.
This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft
RPEP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address
initial concerns about the proposal.

## Submitting an RPEP

Following the above initial discussion, the workflow varies based on whether
any of the RPEP's co-authors are core developers. If one or more of the RPEP's
co-authors are core developers, they are responsible for following the process
outlined below. Otherwise (i.e. none of the co-authors are core developers),
then the RPEP author(s) will need to find a sponsor for the RPEP.

Ideally, a core developer sponsor is identified, but non-core sponsors may also
be selected with the approval of the Steering Council. Members of the GitHub
"RPEP editors" team are pre-approved to be sponsors. The sponsor's job is to
provide guidance to the RPEP author to help them through the logistics of the
RPEP process (somewhat acting like a mentor). Being a sponsor does **not**
disqualify that person from becoming a co-author or RPEP-Delegate later on (but
not both). The sponsor of an RPEP is recorded in the "Sponsor:" field of the
header.

Once the sponsor or the core developer(s) co-authoring the RPEP deem the RPEP
ready for submission, the proposal should be submitted as a draft RPEP via a
`GitHub pull request`\_. The draft must be written in RPEP style as described
below, else it will fail review immediately (although minor errors may be
corrected by the editors).

The standard RPEP workflow is:

- You, the RPEP author, fork the `RPEP repository`\_, and create a file named
  :file:`RPEP-{NNNN}.rst` that contains your new RPEP. :samp:`{NNNN}` should be the next
  available RPEP number not used by a published or in-PR RPEP.

- In the "RPEP:" header field, enter the RPEP number that matches your filename
  as your draft RPEP number.

- In the "Type:" header field, enter "Standards Track",
  "Informational", or "Process" as appropriate, and for the "Status:"
  field enter "Draft". For full details, see `RPEP Header Preamble`\_.

- Update `.github/CODEOWNERS`_ such that any co-author(s) or sponsors
  with write access to the `RPEP repository`_ are listed for your new file.
  This ensures any future pull requests changing the file will be assigned
  to them.

- Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.

- The RPEP editors review your PR for structure, formatting, and other
  errors. For a reST-formatted RPEP, :RPEP:`12` is provided as a template.
  It also provides a complete introduction to reST markup that is used
  in RPEPs. Approval criteria are:

  - It sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense. The
    editors do not consider whether they seem likely to be accepted.
  - The title accurately describes the content.
  - The RPEP's language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.)
    and code style (examples should match :RPEP:`7` & :RPEP:`8`) should be
    correct and conformant. The RPEP text will be automatically checked for
    correct reStructuredText formatting when the pull request is submitted.
    RPEPs with invalid reST markup will not be approved.

  Editors are generally quite lenient about this initial review,
  expecting that problems will be corrected by the reviewing process.
  **Note:** Approval of the RPEP is no guarantee that there are no
  embarrassing mistakes! Correctness is the responsibility of authors
  and reviewers, not the editors.

  If the RPEP isn't ready for approval, an editor will send it back to
  the author for revision, with specific instructions.

- Once approved, they will assign your RPEP a number.

Once the review process is complete, and the RPEP editors approve it (note that
this is _not_ the same as accepting your RPEP!), they will squash commit your
pull request onto main.

The RPEP editors will not unreasonably deny publication of an RPEP. Reasons for
denying RPEP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound,
not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not
in keeping with the ReactPy philosophy. The Steering Council can be consulted
during the approval phase, and are the final arbiter of a draft's RPEP-ability.

Developers with write access to the `RPEP repository`_ may claim RPEP
numbers directly by creating and committing a new RPEP. When doing so, the
developer must handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the
RPEP editors (see `RPEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow`_). This includes
ensuring the initial version meets the expected standards for submitting a
RPEP. Alternately, even developers should submit RPEPs via pull request.
When doing so, you are generally expected to handle the process yourself;
if you need assistance from RPEP editors, mention `@ReactPy/RPEP-editors`
on GitHub.

As updates are necessary, the RPEP author can check in new versions if they
(or a collaborating developer) have write access to the `RPEP repository`\_.
Getting an RPEP number assigned early can be useful for ease of
reference, especially when multiple draft RPEPs are being considered at the
same time.

Standards Track RPEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation. It is generally recommended that at least a
prototype implementation be co-developed with the RPEP, as ideas that sound
good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the
test of implementation.

## Discussing an RPEP

As soon as an RPEP number has been assigned
and the draft RPEP is committed to the `RPEP repository`\_,
a discussion thread for the RPEP should be created
to provide a central place to discuss and review its contents, and the
RPEP should be updated so that the `Discussions-To` header links to it.

The RPEP authors (or sponsor, if applicable) may select any reasonable venue
for the discussion, so long as the the following criteria are met:

- The forum is appropriate to the RPEP's topic.
- The thread is publicly available on the web so that all interested parties
  can participate.
- The discussion is subject to the `ReactPy Community Code of Conduct
<https://www.ReactPy.org/psf/conduct/>`\_.
- A direct link to the current discussion thread is provided in the RPEP
  under the `Discussions-To` header.

The `RPEPs category`_ of the `ReactPy Discourse`_
is the preferred choice for most new RPEPs,
whereas historically the `ReactPy-Dev`_ mailing list was commonly used.
Some specialized topics have specific venues, such as
`Typing-SIG`_ for typing RPEPs or the `Packaging category`\_ on the ReactPy
Discourse for packaging RPEPs. If the RPEP authors are unsure of the best venue,
the RPEP Sponsor and RPEP editors can advise them accordingly.

If an RPEP undergoes a significant re-write or other major, substantive
changes to its proposed specification, a new thread should typically be created
in the chosen venue to solicit additional feedback. If this occurs, the
`Discussions-To` link must be updated and a new `Post-History` entry added
pointing to this new thread.

If it is not chosen as the discussion venue,
a brief announcement post should be made to the `RPEPs category`\_
with at least a link to the rendered RPEP and the `Discussions-To` thread
when the draft RPEP is committed to the repository
and if a major-enough change is made to trigger a new thread.

RPEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on an RPEP
before submitting it for review. However, to avoid long-winded and
open-ended discussions, strategies such as soliciting private or more
narrowly-tailored feedback in the early design phase,
collaborating with other community members with expertise in the RPEP's
subject matter, and picking an appropriately-specialized discussion for the
RPEP's topic (if applicable) should be considered.
RPEP authors should use their discretion here.

Once the RPEP is assigned a number and committed to the RPEP repository,
substantive issues should generally be discussed on the canonical public
thread, as opposed to private channels, GitHub pull request reviews or
unrelated venues. This ensures everyone can follow and contribute,
avoids fragmenting the discussion,
and makes sure it is fully considered as part of the RPEP review process.
Comments, support, concerns and other feedback on this designated thread
are a critical part of what the Steering Council or RPEP-Delegate will
consider when reviewing the RPEP.

## RPEP Review & Resolution

Once the authors have completed an RPEP, they may request a review for
style and consistency from the RPEP editors.
However, content review and acceptance of the RPEP is ultimately the
responsibility of the Steering Council, which is formally initiated by
opening a `Steering Council issue`\_ once the authors (and sponsor, if any)
determine the RPEP is ready for final review and resolution.

To expedite the process in selected cases (e.g. when a change is clearly
beneficial and ready to be accepted, but the RPEP hasn't been formally submitted
for review yet), the Steering Council may also initiate an RPEP review, first
notifying the RPEP author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.

The final authority for RPEP approval is the Steering Council. However, whenever
a new RPEP is put forward, any core developer who believes they are suitably
experienced to make the final decision on that RPEP may offer to serve as its
RPEP-Delegate by `notifying the Steering Council <Steering Council issue_>`\_
of their intent. If the Steering Council approves their offer,
the RPEP-Delegate will then have the authority to approve or reject that RPEP.

The term "RPEP-Delegate" is used under the Steering Council governance model
for the RPEP's designated decision maker,
who is recorded in the "RPEP-Delegate" field in the RPEP's header.
The term "BDFL-Delegate" is a deprecated alias for RPEP-Delegate, a legacy of
the time when when ReactPy was led by `a BDFL <ReactPy's BDFL_>`\_.
Any legacy references to "BDFL-Delegate" should be treated as equivalent to
"RPEP-Delegate".

An individual offering to nominate themselves as an RPEP-Delegate must notify
the relevant authors and (when present) the sponsor for the RPEP, and submit
their request to the Steering Council
(which can be done via a `new issue <Steering Council issue_>`\_ ).
Those taking on this responsibility are free to seek
additional guidance from the Steering Council at any time, and are also expected
to take the advice and perspectives of other core developers into account.

The Steering Council will generally approve such self-nominations by default,
but may choose to decline them.
Possible reasons for the Steering Council declining a
self-nomination as RPEP-Delegate include, but are not limited to, perceptions of
a potential conflict of interest (e.g. working for the same organisation as the
RPEP submitter), or simply considering another potential RPEP-Delegate to be
more appropriate. If core developers (or other community members) have concerns
regarding the suitability of an RPEP-Delegate for any given RPEP, they may ask
the Steering Council to review the delegation.

If no volunteer steps forward, then the Steering Council will approach core
developers (and potentially other ReactPy community members) with relevant
expertise, in an attempt to identify a candidate that is willing to serve as
RPEP-Delegate for that RPEP. If no suitable candidate can be found, then the
RPEP will be marked as Deferred until one is available.

Previously appointed RPEP-Delegates may choose to step down, or be asked to step
down by the Council, in which case a new RPEP-Delegate will be appointed in the
same manner as for a new RPEP (including deferral of the RPEP if no suitable
replacement can be found). In the event that an RPEP-Delegate is asked to step
down, this will overrule any prior acceptance or rejection of the RPEP, and it
will revert to Draft status.

When such standing delegations are put in place, the Steering Council will
maintain sufficient public records to allow subsequent Councils, the core
developers, and the wider ReactPy community to understand the delegations that
currently exist, why they were put in place, and the circumstances under which
they may no longer be needed.

For an RPEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate
the interpreter unduly. Finally, a proposed enhancement must be
"ReactPyic" in order to be accepted by the Steering Council. (However,
"ReactPyic" is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to
the Steering Council. This logic is intentionally circular.) See :RPEP:`2`
for standard library module acceptance criteria.

Except where otherwise approved by the Steering Council,
pronouncements of RPEP resolution will be posted to the
`RPEPs category`_ on the `ReactPy Discourse`_.

Once an RPEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed. When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated
into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to "Final".

To allow gathering of additional design and interface feedback before committing
to long term stability for a language feature or standard library API, an RPEP
may also be marked as "Provisional". This is short for "Provisionally Accepted",
and indicates that the proposal has been accepted for inclusion in the reference
implementation, but additional user feedback is needed before the full design
can be considered "Final". Unlike regular accepted RPEPs, provisionally accepted
RPEPs may still be Rejected or Withdrawn _even after the related changes have
been included in a ReactPy release_.

Wherever possible, it is considered preferable to reduce the scope of a proposal
to avoid the need to rely on the "Provisional" status (e.g. by deferring some
features to later RPEPs), as this status can lead to version compatibility
challenges in the wider ReactPy ecosystem. :RPEP:`411` provides additional details
on potential use cases for the Provisional status.

an RPEP can also be assigned the status "Deferred". The RPEP author or an
editor can assign the RPEP this status when no progress is being made
on the RPEP. Once an RPEP is deferred, an RPEP editor can reassign it
to draft status.

an RPEP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this
fact. The "Withdrawn" status is similar - it means that the RPEP author
themselves has decided that the RPEP is actually a bad idea, or has
accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When an RPEP is Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn, the RPEP should be updated
accordingly. In addition to updating the Status field, at the very least
the Resolution header should be added with a direct link
to the relevant post making a decision on the RPEP.

RPEPs can also be superseded by a different RPEP, rendering the original
obsolete. This is intended for Informational RPEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of RPEPs are as follows:

.. image:: RPEP-0001/process_flow.svg
:class: invert-in-dark-mode
:alt: RPEP process flow diagram

While not shown in the diagram, "Accepted" RPEPs may technically move to
"Rejected" or "Withdrawn" even after acceptance. This will only occur if
the implementation process reveals fundamental flaws in the design that were
not noticed prior to acceptance of the RPEP. Unlike Provisional RPEPs, these
transitions are only permitted if the accepted proposal has _not_ been included
in a ReactPy release - released changes must instead go through the regular
deprecation process (which may require a new RPEP providing the rationale for
the deprecation).

Some Informational and Process RPEPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. :RPEP:`1` (this RPEP).

## RPEP Maintenance

In general, RPEPs are no longer substantially modified after they have reached
the Accepted, Final, Rejected or Superseded state. Once resolution is reached,
an RPEP is considered a historical document rather than a living specification.
Formal documentation of the expected behavior should be maintained elsewhere,
such as the `Language Reference`_ for core features, the `Library Reference`_
for standard library modules or the `PyPA Specifications`\_ for packaging.

If changes based on implementation experience and user feedback are made to
Standards track RPEPs while in the Provisional or (with SC approval) Accepted
state, they should be noted in the RPEP, such that the RPEP accurately describes
the implementation at the point where it is marked Final.

Active (Informational and Process) RPEPs may be updated over time to reflect
changes to development practices and other details. The precise process
followed in these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the RPEP
in question.

Occasionally, a Deferred or even a Withdrawn RPEP may be resurrected
with major updates, but it is often better to just propose a new one.

# What belongs in a successful RPEP?

Each RPEP should have the following parts/sections:

1. Preamble -- :rfc:`2822` style headers containing meta-data about the
   RPEP, including the RPEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for RPEPs that want to
   change the ReactPy language, library, or ecosystem. It should
   clearly explain why the existing language specification is
   inadequate to address the problem that the RPEP solves. This can
   include collecting documented support for the RPEP from important
   projects in the ReactPy ecosystem. RPEP submissions without
   sufficient motivation may be rejected.

4. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing why particular design decisions were made. It should
   describe alternate designs that were considered and related work,
   e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

5. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new language feature. The
   specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable implementations for at least the current major ReactPy
   platforms (ReactPy, Jython, IronReactPy, PyPy).

6. Backwards Compatibility -- All RPEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity. The RPEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. RPEP
   submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
   may be rejected outright.

7. Security Implications -- If there are security concerns in relation
   to the RPEP, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make
   sure reviewers of the RPEP are aware of them.

8. How to Teach This -- For an RPEP that adds new functionality or changes
   language behavior, it is helpful to include a section on how to
   teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the RPEP to their
   work.

   This section may include key points and recommended documentation
   changes that would help users adopt a new feature or migrate their
   code to use a language change.

9. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any RPEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the RPEP is accepted. While there is merit
   to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and
   rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus
   and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many
   discussions of API details.

   The final implementation must include test code and documentation
   appropriate for either the ReactPy language reference or the
   standard library reference.

10. Rejected Ideas -- Throughout the discussion of an RPEP, various ideas
    will be proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should
    be recorded along with the reasoning as to why they were rejected.
    This both helps record the thought process behind the final version
    of the RPEP as well as preventing people from bringing up the same
    rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.

    In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the
    Rationale section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas
    were not ultimately pursued.

11. Open Issues -- While an RPEP is in draft, ideas can come up which
    warrant further discussion. Those ideas should be recorded so people
    know that they are being thought about but do not have a concrete
    resolution. This helps make sure all issues required for the RPEP to be
    ready for consideration are complete and reduces people duplicating
    prior discussion.

12. Footnotes -- A collection of footnotes cited in the RPEP, and
    a place to list non-inline hyperlink targets.

13. Copyright/license -- Each new RPEP must be placed under a dual license of
    public domain and CC0-1.0-Universal\_ (see this RPEP for an example).

# RPEP Formats and Templates

RPEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the reStructuredText\_ format.
reStructuredText allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to
read, but also results in good-looking and functional HTML. :RPEP:`12`
contains instructions and a :RPEP:`RPEP template <12#suggested-sections>`.

The RPEP text files are automatically
`converted to HTML <https://RPEPs.ReactPy.org/docs/rendering_system/>`**
(via a `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`\_-based :RPEP:`build system <676>`)
for easier `online reading <https://RPEPs.ReactPy.org/>`**.

# RPEP Header Preamble

Each RPEP must begin with an :rfc:`2822` style header preamble. The headers
must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "\*" are
optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

.. code-block:: text

    RPEP: <RPEP number>
    Title: <RPEP title>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>

- Sponsor: <real name of sponsor>
- RPEP-Delegate: <RPEP delegate's real name>
  Discussions-To: <URL of current canonical discussion thread>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Provisional | Deferred | Rejected |
  Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
- Topic: <Governance | Packaging | Release | Typing>
- Content-Type: text/x-rst
- Requires: <RPEP numbers>
  Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
- ReactPy-Version: <version number>
  Post-History: <dates, in dd-mmm-yyyy format,
  inline-linked to RPEP discussion threads>
- Replaces: <RPEP number>
- Superseded-By: <RPEP number>
- Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the RPEP. The format of the Author header
values must be:

.. code-block:: text

    Random J. User <random@example.com>

if the email address is included, and just:

.. code-block:: text

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following :rfc:`2822` continuation line conventions. Note that personal
email addresses in RPEPs will be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.

The Sponsor field records which developer (core, or otherwise approved by the
Steering Council) is sponsoring the RPEP. If one of the authors of the RPEP is a
core developer then no sponsor is necessary and thus this field should be left
out.

The RPEP-Delegate field is used to record the individual appointed by the
Steering Council to make the final decision on whether or not to approve or
reject an RPEP. (The delegate's email address is currently omitted due to a
limitation in the email address masking for reStructuredText RPEPs)

_Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track RPEPs
only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or
other web resource where the pronouncement about
(i.e. approval or rejection of) the RPEP is made._

The Discussions-To header provides the URL to the current
canonical discussion thread for the RPEP.
For email lists, this should be a direct link to the thread in the list's
archives, rather than just a mailto: or hyperlink to the list itself.

The Type header specifies the type of RPEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The optional Topic header lists the special topic, if any,
the RPEP belongs under.
See the :ref:`topic-index` for the existing topics.

The format of an RPEP is specified with a Content-Type header.
All RPEPs must use reStructuredText (see :RPEP:`12`),
and have a value of `text/x-rst`, the default.
Previously, plaintext RPEPs used `text/plain` (see :RPEP:`9`).

The Created header records the date that the RPEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of and corresponding
URLs to the Discussions-To threads for the RPEP, with the former as the
linked text, and the latter as the link target.
Both sets of dates should be in `dd-mmm-yyyy` format, e.g. `14-Aug-2001`.

Standards Track RPEPs will typically have a ReactPy-Version header which
indicates the version of ReactPy that the feature will be released with.
Standards Track RPEPs without a ReactPy-Version header indicate
interoperability standards that will initially be supported through
external libraries and tools, and then potentially supplemented by a later RPEP
to add support to the standard library. Informational and Process RPEPs do
not need a ReactPy-Version header.

RPEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the RPEP numbers that this
RPEP depends on.

RPEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that an RPEP has
been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of
the RPEP that replaces the current document. The newer RPEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the RPEP that it rendered
obsolete.

# Auxiliary Files

RPEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files should be
named `RPEP-XXXX-Y.ext`, where "XXXX" is the RPEP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").

Alternatively, all support files may be placed in a subdirectory called
`RPEP-XXXX`, where "XXXX" is the RPEP number. When using a subdirectory, there
are no constraints on the names used in files.

# Changing Existing RPEPs

Draft RPEPs are freely open for discussion and proposed modification, at the
discretion of the authors, until submitted to the Steering Council or
RPEP-Delegate for review and resolution. Substantive content changes should
generally be first proposed on the RPEP's discussion thread listed in its
`Discussions-To` header, while copyedits and corrections can be submitted
as a `GitHub issue`_ or `GitHub pull request`_.
RPEP authors with write access to the RPEP repository can update the RPEPs
themselves by using `git push` or a GitHub PR to submit their changes.
For guidance on modifying other RPEPs, consult the `RPEP Maintenance`\_ section.

See the `Contributing Guide`\_ for additional details, and when in doubt,
please check first with the RPEP author and/or an RPEP editor.

# Transferring RPEP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of RPEPs to a
new champion. In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred RPEP, but that's really up to the
original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the RPEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because the author doesn't agree with the
direction of the RPEP. One aim of the RPEP process is to try to build
consensus around an RPEP, but if that's not possible, an author can always
submit a competing RPEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of an RPEP, you can also do this via
pull request. Fork the `RPEP repository`\_, make your ownership modification,
and submit a pull request. You should mention both the original author and
`@ReactPy/RPEP-editors` in a comment on the pull request. (If the original
author's GitHub username is unknown, use email.) If the original author
doesn't respond in a timely manner, the RPEP editors will make a
unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

# RPEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

an RPEP editor must be added to the `@ReactPy/RPEP-editors` group on GitHub and
must watch the `RPEP repository`\_.

Note that developers with write access to the `RPEP repository`\_ may
handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the RPEP editors.
Alternately, even developers may request assistance from RPEP editors by
mentioning `@ReactPy/RPEP-editors` on GitHub.

For each new RPEP that comes in an editor does the following:

- Make sure that the RPEP is either co-authored by a core developer, has a core
  developer as a sponsor, or has a sponsor specifically approved for this RPEP
  by the Steering Council.

- Read the RPEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

- The title should accurately describe the content.

- The file name extension is correct (i.e. `.rst`).

- Ensure that everyone listed as a sponsor or co-author of the RPEP who has write
  access to the `RPEP repository`_ is added to `.github/CODEOWNERS`_.

- Skim the RPEP for obvious defects in language (spelling, grammar,
  sentence structure, etc.), and code style (examples should conform to
  :RPEP:`7` & :RPEP:`8`). Editors may correct problems themselves, but are
  not required to do so (reStructuredText syntax is checked by the repo's CI).

- If a project is portrayed as benefiting from or supporting the RPEP, make sure
  there is some direct indication from the project included to make the support
  clear. This is to avoid an RPEP accidentally portraying a project as supporting
  an RPEP when in fact the support is based on conjecture.

If the RPEP isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions. If reST formatting is a
problem, ask the author(s) to use :RPEP:`12` as a template and resubmit.

Once the RPEP is ready for the repository, an RPEP editor will:

- Check that the author has selected a valid RPEP number or assign them a
  number if they have not (almost always just the next available number, but
  sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).

  Remember that numbers below 100 are meta-RPEPs.

- Check that the author has correctly labeled the RPEP's type
  ("Standards Track", "Informational", or "Process"), and marked its
  status as "Draft".

- Ensure all CI build and lint checks pass without errors,
  and there are no obvious issues in the rendered preview output.

- Merge the new (or updated) RPEP.

- Inform the author of the next steps (open a discussion thread and
  update the RPEP with it, post an announcement, etc).

Updates to existing RPEPs should be submitted as a `GitHub pull request`\_.

Many RPEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access
to the ReactPy codebase. The RPEP editors monitor the RPEP repository
for changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or
markup mistakes they see.

RPEP editors don't pass judgment on RPEPs. They merely do the
administrative & editorial part (which is generally a low volume task).
